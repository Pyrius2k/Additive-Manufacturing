# ‚öôÔ∏è Parallel Extruder Head for Continuous Fiber 3D Printing

This repository contains the **firmware, design files, and process documentation** for a custom-built extruder head designed for the 3D printing of continuous fiber-reinforced objects. Inspired by the **Markforged concept**, this project features a **parallel dual-extrusion system** capable of handling both standard filament (e.g., PLA) and **coated carbon fibers**, enabling the production of high-strength composite prints.

## üéØ Project Goals & Key Features

The primary objective of this project is to significantly improve the **tensile strength and structural integrity** of 3D-printed parts by embedding continuous or segmented carbon fibers into the print path.

### ‚úÖ Key Features:

- **Fiber Reinforcement**: Optimized for co-extruding coated carbon fibers alongside standard filament (e.g., PLA).
- **Precision Mechanics**:
    - **Dedicated Stepper Motor** for accurate, separate fiber feeding.
    - **Servo Motor** with a sharp blade to precisely cut fiber segments after each reinforced section.
- **Lightweight Design**: Carefully engineered to reduce head weight for faster, more accurate prints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Overview & Realization

The custom print head was designed and realized with a focus on compactness and precision. It is fully integrated with slicing software (e.g., Cura) to allow for **strategic fiber placement** in designated toolpaths.

## üíª Firmware & Electronics Integration (Marlin & RAMPS)

The extruder head's functionality is achieved by **modifying Marlin firmware** to handle the additional fiber-feeding stepper and servo-controlled cutter. All components were connected to a **RAMPS 1.4 control board**.

### üîå RAMPS Connection Overview:

The following pins were utilized to integrate the custom extruder head while maintaining the base FLM printer functionality:

| Pin/Port Function | Purpose in Project | Used Port |
|:------------------|:-------------------|:----------|
| **1. Heating Element** | Heating for the standard filament extruder (E0). | D10 |
| **2. Fiber Stepper** | Dedicated stepper motor for **fiber feed control**. | E1 |
| **3. End Stops** | Standard X, Y, Z limit switches for printer homing. | End Stop Pins |
| **4. Thermistor** | Temperature sensing for the hotend. | T0 |
| **5. Steppers (X/Y/Z)**| Standard motion control for the FLM printer. | X, Y, Z Drivers |
| **6. Auxiliary (AUX)** | Used for controlling the **fiber-cutting Servo Motor**. | AUX-4 (Specific Pin) |
| **7. Fan 1** | Standard part cooling fan. | D9 |
| **8. Fan 2** | Used as an auxiliary fan or extruder cooling. | D8 |

### üìÑ Firmware Modifications:

- Custom **Pin Assignments** in `Configuration_adv.h` for the new stepper (E1) and servo (AUX pin).
- G-code logic to precisely trigger the servo cutting action at the end of a fiber segment.
- Pulse generation and timing control for the stepper fiber extrusion mechanism.
- Control integrated via `M` or `G` commands for precise control within the G-code stream.
